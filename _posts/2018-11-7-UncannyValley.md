You know when you watch a horror movie and someone or something feels off. You don't really know why but you still stick to your gut. This might be because of the Uncanny Valley effect. The uncanny valley is a common unsettling feeling people experience most commonly in androids and audio/visual simulations that closely resemble humans in many respects but are not quite convincingly realistic. I believe when something is human enough to the point where our brains register the being being human but not quite enough to fully trust the being. Now i'm talking about humaniod creatures where in they are another bipedal creature with speech and hands like a mind flayer from d&d. I'm talking like strainght inhuman human things like ths android shown in this image.\

Now I this a graph for robot to antroids and when the uncanny valley effect holds. There is a certain point where sonething is too human like wthout being it causing displeasure to the object making said person put in front of it to be unconfrotable. However if something has human like behaviors like emotions and facial exprssion that still feel natraul within the beings nature the effect will not take hold only seeming rather charming and if you add to much human to the point where people wonÂ´t feel threaten by the person unless they were say holding a weapon.
