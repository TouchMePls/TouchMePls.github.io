## Basic Killers

In most standard horror films the thing antagonizing the the brainless protagonists is a killer.
And even more common in the killer is a large man who gives the silent treatment and wields a large ass melee weapon and never uses ranged weapons because the victims will trip sooner or later and it wouldn't be graphic if somebody didn't lose their minds. Now why do we like them. For some it's just how iconic some of them are. Like, when was the last you saw a hockey mask and the first thing you think about is a goaltender and not Jason. For others it's how they kill. Sometimes the kills are extremely graphic and serious. These are the staples of what makes the KILLERS in these movies so good. No one cares about some dumbass kids trespassing in some place it's how they die is why people watch these movies.

##Art of the kill

Me being slightly sadistic I will enjoy the death of people who die from lack of common sense. Now my enjoyability of death depends on one thing. How entertaining it is. Now I don't really care if someone gets their head cut off in one chop or fall down a cliff. What makes it entertaining is how painful and creative the death is. No murderer in horror movies can kill clean they gotta slam someone's head on a hard surface until their head cracked open like an egg. This is what I like since itś more gruesome and much more enjoyable to watch in a messed up way. 

Now a killer most important means of killing is their melee since gun are toys in these worlds. These are the icons of these killers as its what make them. Claws,machetes,and chainsaws  make the kills are the better. The weapons personalized to the way the killer likes to kill their victims and is the reason why people like them.


## Man vs a force of nature

In the rare occasion where the killer isn't a superhuman psychopath with a certain fetish then it will be my personal favorite, another worldly being. Famous examples include the xenomorph,the thing, the predator(kinda cheating) a quiet place monsters, and the blob. The thing I like about these ones rather than their humanoid counterparts is how many things you could do with them. The xenomorph has an in depth lore about it´s specifies and doesn't can abilities can be explained by biology and not some magic lightning bolts and hellflame and makes it more interesting as you find out the tactics and what it can do alongside the protagonists. They can also make stuff up such as alien queens but it still works
