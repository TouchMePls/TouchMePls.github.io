title: What makes horror scary
---
Fear I feel is an intreasting emotion. It shows peoples true colors when faced with it. It makes people do things they would never otherwise do when their scared. Phobias can often tell you a lot about people of what people will and not do. For me I find it a thrilling emotions. Fear of the unknown is main example where it feels like it calling. Isn't that why watch scar things to be scared. Even odd things can be scary like try to explain this.Tell me how you feel,for you should clearly feel lust.
